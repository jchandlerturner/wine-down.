# wine down
*Cohort 35 Capstone*

<b>Project Overview</b>

A journal app that tracks wine using ReactJS with CRUD capabilities.

<b>Challenge Statement</b>

Often, people forget which wines theyâ€™ve tried and what they thought of it, which can make it difficult when purchasing wine. Along with this, restaurant workers tend to not have a convenient place aside from pieces of paper, that they can keep their wine notes to stay up to date on ever-changing wine lists. 

How can we help wine lovers and restaurant staff track, rate, and favorite wine tastings with on-the-go access? 

<b>Personas</b>

I based my personas off of my friends who are casual wine drinkers, and also my coworkers in the service industry who are always losing their wine notes. 

<b>Wireframes and Mockups</b>

Initially, I researched color palettes on Pinterest and researched other wine-centric websites and apps to get color inspiration. 

I landed on my color palette because I felt like it showcased the different colors of wine I was trying to show on my app. 

I used Figma and hand drawn sketches to prototype the Website:
